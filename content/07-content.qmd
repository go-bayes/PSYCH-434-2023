## Downloads

Below is a link to the R script that will allow you to download the data and exercises. Copy the contents on your screen to a new R script, and run the script from the begging. Before class, it will be useful for you to: 

1. Run "source()" file. 
2. Download the synthetic data. 
3. Create a folder in your Rstudio project called "data"
4. Place the downloaded file in your data folder.

## What is a Cause and What is an Effect? 




## Why is Causal Inference a “missing data” problem?
