    "section": "Course Learning Objectives",
    "text": "Course Learning Objectives\n\nEthical Reasoning. Beginning in week 1, we will explore questions that are typically reserved for philosophy courses but are central to the conduct of psychology: why do we need to think about right and wrong in science? What if different people have different ideas about what is right and wrong in science? Is there hope for ethical progress? Can science play a role in ethical progress? We will provide you with a set of strategies for addressing these questions.\nProgramming in R. Beginning in week 2, we will teach you the basics of programming in the statistical language R. The past several decades have brought extraordinary new tools to psychological scientists, many of which require literacy in computer programming. While some of you may find the thought of programming thrilling, others may find it terrifying or boring! We promise that programming can be fun. This course is designed to help you find that joy.\nUnderstanding measurement. Beginning in week 3 the course will turn its focus to developing skills for constructing and validating measures in cross-cultural research. Again these skills will be invaluable for a wide range of tasks you may face in psychological science and will help you to address problems that will arise in other areas of your research and work. Measurement will occupy our attention through week 6.\nUnderstanding causal inference. Beginning in week 7 and for the following four weeks, the course will impart skills that you require to disentangle causation from correlation. Again our focus will be on the special problems that arise for cultural datasets. Notably, in psychological science, causal inference remains underdeveloped, and the material in this part of the course will position you to make potentially important contributions, whether or not your interests lie in cross-cultural psychology."

    "text": "Course Learning Objectives\n\nEthical Reasoning. Beginning in week 1, we will explore questions that are typically reserved for philosophy courses but are central to the conduct of psychology: why do we need to think about right and wrong in science? What if different people have different ideas about what is right and wrong in science? Is there hope for ethical progress? Can science play a role in ethical progress? We will provide you with a set of strategies for addressing these questions.\nProgramming in R. Beginning in week 2, we will teach you the basics of programming in the statistical language R. The past several decades have brought extraordinary new tools to psychological scientists, many of which require literacy in computer programming. While some of you may find the thought of programming thrilling, others may find it terrifying or boring! We promise that programming can be fun. This course is designed to help you find that joy.\nUnderstanding measurement. Beginning in week 3 the course will turn its focus to developing skills for constructing and validating measures in cross-cultural research. Again these skills will be invaluable for a wide range of tasks you may face in psychological science and will help you to address problems that will arise in other areas of your research and work. Measurement will occupy our attention through week 6.\nUnderstanding causal inference. Beginning in week 7 and for the following four weeks, the course will impart skills that you require to disentangle causation from correlation. Again our focus will be on the special problems that arise for cultural datasets. Notably, in psychological science, causal inference remains underdeveloped, and the material in this part of the course will position you to make potentially important contributions, whether or not your interests lie in cross-cultural psychology."

    "text": "Part 1: The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference as a Missing Data Problem\nTo understand the fundamental problem of causal inference, let’s first define two potential outcomes for each individual in our study:\n\nY_i^{a = 1}: The cognitive ability of child i if they were bilingual. This is the counterfactual outcome when A = 1.\nY_i^{a = 0}:: The cognitive ability of child i if they were monolingual. This is the counterfactual outcome when A = 0.\n\nThe causal effect of bilingualism on cognitive ability for individual i is then defined as the difference between these potential outcomes:\n\n\\text{Causal Effect}_i = Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}\n\nNote that sometimes we will write this contrast as:\n\n\\text{Causal Effect}_i = Y(1) - Y(0)\n\nor\n\n\\text{Causal Effect}_i = Y^{1} - Y^{0}\n\nWe say there is a causal effect if:\n\nY^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}  \\neq 0\n\nThe Philosopher David Hume defines causation in the following way:\n\n“We may define a cause to be an object followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second [definition 1]. Or, in other words, where, if the first object had not been, the second never would have existed [definition 2].”  - Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding, and Concerning the Principles of Morals\n\nThis is a contrast between two states of the world. One in which a child recieves bi-lingual exposure and one in which a child does not.\nHowever, consider that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for each child. The contrast we require for identifying a causal effect is typically not observed.\nRobert Frost writes,\n\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,\u000b And sorry I could not travel both\u000b And be one traveler, long I stood\u000b And looked down one as far as I could\u000b To where it bent in the undergrowth;\u000b\n\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\u000b And having perhaps the better claim,\u000b Because it was grassy and wanted wear;\u000b Though as for that the passing there\u000b Had worn them really about the same,\u000b \u000b And both that morning equally lay\u000b In leaves no step had trodden black.\u000b Oh, I kept the first for another day!\u000b Yet knowing how way leads on to way,\u000b I doubted if I should ever come back.\u000b\n\n\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\u000b Somewhere ages and ages hence:\u000b Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—\u000b I took the one less traveled by,\u000b And that has made all the difference. – The Road Not Taken\n\n“And sorry I could not travel both. And be one traveller\\dots”\nThe fact that causal contrasts are not observed on individuals is called “The fundamental problem of causal inference.”\nWe will discuss how this missing data problem arises in different research designs and explore strategies for addressing it.\nFor now, note that the problem isn’t merely one of statistical analysis on the data. The problem is that the relevant data to identify individual causal effects are missing."

By randomly assigning individuals to treatment (bilingual) or control (monolingual) groups, we create comparable groups that allow us to estimate causal effects.\nRandom assignment ensures that all observed and unobserved confounders are balanced between the treatment and control groups on average, satisfying the conditionally exchangeable assumption.\nThe key benefits of randomized experiments are:\n\nUnbiased estimation of average treatment effects.\nControl of both observed and unobserved confounding.\nFacilitated interpretation of causal effects.\n\nNotice that the results of an experiment recover Average Treatment Effects, not individual causal effects. Although a treament might be beneficial for the majority of people, it might not be benefitial for you.\nThis consideration may be extended to subgroups. Although a treatment might be beneficial, on average, for the majority of a population, it might not be benefitial for a sub-population. However, unlike individual causal effects, we may obtain causal effect estimates within sub-populations. We will will return to this topic next week."

As a result, there may be confounding factors that affect both the treatment assignment and the outcome, making it difficult to identify causal effects.\nIn this context, some strategies to address confounding include:\n\nMatching: Pair individuals with similar observed covariates in treatment and control groups. We will discuss various matching techniques, such as exact matching, nearest-neighbor matching, and optimal matching.\nPropensity score methods: Use the propensity score (the probability of treatment given covariates) to balance treatment and control groups on observed covariates. We will cover propensity score matching, weighting, and subclassification, and discuss their advantages and limitations.\nRegression adjustment: include potential confounders as control variables in a regression model. We will discuss the assumptions behind this approach, as well as techniques for model selection and diagnostics.\n\nHowever, these methods rely on the assumption of conditionally exchangeable treatment assignment, which is often unverifiable. They can only account for observed confounding, leaving the possibility of unobserved confounders affecting our causal estimates. For this reason we use sentistive analyses (topic next week. )"

We focused on the example of bilingualism and cognitive abilities in children, but these concepts and methods can be applied to a wide range of research questions in cross-cultural psychology. As researchers, it is essential to be aware of these issues and to use appropriate methods to make valid causal inferences from our data. In later lectures, we will develop more cross-cultural research examples to illustrate the application of these methods in various contexts."

    "text": "Review: The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference as a Missing Data Problem\nRecall the fundamental problem of causal inference, returning to the question of whether bilingualism improves cognitive abilities:\n\nY_i^{a = 1}: The cognitive ability of child i if they were bilingual. This is the counterfactual outcome when A = 1.\nY_i^{a = 0}:: The cognitive ability of child i if they were monolingual. This is the counterfactual outcome when A = 0.\n\nThe causal effect of bilingualism on cognitive ability for individual i is then defined as the difference between these potential outcomes:\n\n\\text{Causal Effect}_i = Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}\n\nWe say there is a causal effect if:\n\nY^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}  \\neq 0\n\nHowever, we only observe one of the potential outcomes for each child. The other outcome is not observed because physics prevents a child from both receiving and not receiving bilingual exposure.\nThe fact that causal contrasts are not observed on individuals is called “The fundamental problem of causal inference.”\nAlthough we typically cannot observe individual causal effects, under certain assumptions we can obtain average causal effects.\n\\begin{align}\nE(\\delta) = E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\\\\n          ~  = E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0}) \\\\\n          ~  = ATE\n\\end{align}\nWe may identify average causal effects from the data when the following assumptions are met:\n\nCausal Consistency: The values of exposure under comparisons correspond to well-defined interventions that, in turn, correspond to the versions of treatment in the data.(see: Chatton, Hernan & Robbins)\nPositivity: The probability of receiving every value of the exposure within all strata of co-variates is greater than zero\nExchangeablility: The conditional probability of receiving every value of an exposure level, though not decided by the investigators, depends only on the measured covariates (see: Chatton, Hernan & Robbins)\n\nFurther assumptions:\n\nNo Interference: also known as the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), requires that the treatment given to one unit (e.g., person, group, organization) does not interfere with the potential outcomes of another unit. Put differently, there are no “spillover” effects. Note: this assumption may be thought to be part of causal consistency, namely individual has only one potential outcome under each treatment condition.\nCorrectly specified model: the requirement that the underlying statistical model used to estimate causal effects accurately represents the true relationships between the variables of interest. We say the model should be able to capture “the functional form” of the relationship between the treatment, the outcome, and any covariates. The functional form of the model should be flexible enough to capture the true underlying relationship. If the model’s functional form is incorrect, the estimated causal effects may be biased. Additionally, the model must handle omitted variable bias by including all relevant confounders and should correctly handle missing data. We will return to the bias arising from missing data in the weeks ahead. For now, it is important to note that an assumption of causal inference is that our model is correctly specified."

    "text": "Propensity Scores and Confounding Control\nRecall that last week, we considered confounding control by regression adjustment.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nATE = E[Y^{a=1}|L = l] - E[Y^{a=0}|L = l] ~ \\text{for any value}~l\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\n“We say that a set L of measured non-descendants of L is a sufficient set for confounding adjustment when conditioning on L blocks all backdoor paths–that is, the treated and the untreated are exchangeable within levels of L” (Hernan & Robins, What IF p. 86)\n\nThe equation you provided represents the average treatment effect (ATE) when conditioning on a set of covariates L:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nATE = E[Y^{a=1}|L = l] - E[Y^{a=0}|L = l] ~ \\text{for any value}~l\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThis formula calculates the expected difference in outcomes between treated (a=1) and untreated (a=0) groups, given a specific value of the covariates l.\nInverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) is a technique used in causal inference to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) when comparing two groups in observational studies. The idea is to create a pseudo-population where the treatment assignment is independent of the observed covariates by assigning weights to each individual based on their propensity scores (i.e., the probability of receiving the treatment given their covariates).\nLet’s denote the treatment indicator by A, where A = 1 if an individual receives treatment and A = 0otherwise. Let L represent the vector of observed covariates, and Y^a be the potential outcomes. The propensity score, e(L), is defined as the probability of receiving treatment given the observed covariates:\ne(L) = P(A = 1 \\mid L)\nTo estimate the ATE using IPTW, we first compute the inverse probability of treatment weights, which are defined as:\nW_i = \\frac{A_i}{e(L_i)} + \\frac{1 - A_i}{1 - e(L_i)}\nwhere W_i is the IPTW weight for individual i, A_i is the treatment indicator for individual i, and e(L_i) is the propensity score for individual i.\nNow, the ATE can be estimated as:\nATE_{\\text{iptw}} = \\frac{\\sum [W_i \\cdot (A_i \\cdot Y_i)]}{\\sum [W_i \\cdot A_i]} - \\frac{\\sum [W_i \\cdot ((1 - A_i) \\cdot Y_i)]}{\\sum [W_i \\cdot (1 - A_i)]}\nIn this equation, the numerator of the first term represents the sum of the weighted potential outcomes for the treated group, and the denominator is the sum of the weights for the treated group. The second term is similar but for the control group (those who did not receive the treatment). The ATE_{\\text{iptw}} represents the difference in outcomes between the treated and control groups in the pseudo-population created by applying IPTW."

Let Y_{r} denote the counterfactual outcome Y when another experimental intervention R is set to level r. Following VanderWeele (2009), we can define interaction and effect modification as follows:\n\nInteraction (causal interaction) on the difference scale, conditional on confounders L, occurs when:\n\nE(Y^{a1,r1}|L=l) - E(Y^{a0,r1}|L=l) \\neq E(Y^{a1,r0}|L=l) - E(Y^{a0,r0}|L=l)\nIn this case, we are considering a double intervention, and interaction occurs when the combined effect of interventions A and R is not equal to the sum of their individual effects.\n\nEffect Modification (also known as “heterogeneity of treatment effects”) occurs when the causal effect of intervention A varies across different levels of another variable R:\n\nE(Y^{a=1}|R=r_1, L=l) - E(Y^{a=0}|R=r_1, L=l) \\neq E(Y^{a=1}|R=r_2, L=l) - E(Y^{a=0}|R=r_2, L=l)\nEffect modification indicates that the magnitude of the causal effect of intervention A depends on the level of the modifier variable R. It is important to note that effect modification can be observed even when there is no direct causal interaction between the treatment and the modifier variable.\nIn short, interaction in causal inference refers to a situation where the combined effect of two interventions is not equal to the sum of their individual effects. Effect modification, on the other hand, occurs when the causal effect of one intervention varies across different levels of another variable.\nBy clearly distinguishing between these two concept, researchers can better ask, and answer, questions about human thinking and behaviour. For comparative research, we are typically interested in effect-modification which requires subgroup analysis.\nIn today’s workbook, you will learn how to conduct doubly robust subgroup analysis."

    "text": "Graphs of Canonical confounders\n\nConfounding by Common Cause.\nThe problem of confounding by common cause arises when there is an unmeasured or unaccounted-for variable, denoted as “L,” that influences both the treatment variable, denoted as “A,” and the outcome variable, denoted as “Y.” This confounder L creates an association between A and Y that is not solely due to the direct causal effect of A on Y. Instead, the observed association between A and Y may be partially or entirely driven by the presence of L, making it difficult to isolate and accurately estimate the true causal effect of A on Y.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Counfounding by common cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: adjust for the pre-exposure confounder\nConfounding by a pre-exposure confounder can be addressed by adjusting for it. A pre-exposure confounder refers to a variable that affects both the treatment (A) and the outcome (Y) but is measured before the treatment is assigned. By adjusting for this confounder, typically through statistical techniques such as stratification, regression, or matching, we can account for its influence and isolate the true causal effect of the treatment on the outcome. This adjustment helps to mitigate the bias caused by the confounder, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the causal relationship between the treatment and the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Solution: adjust for pre-exposure confounder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond problem: conditioning on a common effect (Collider Stratification)\nConditioning on a common effect refers to a situation where there is a variable, denoted as “L,” that is affected by both the treatment (A) and an outcome (Y). When conditioning on L, it creates a spurious association between A and Y, making it challenging to determine the true causal relationship. This occurs because the relationship between A and Y becomes confounded by the common effect L. Conditioning on L can lead to biased estimates and erroneous conclusions about the causal effect of A on Y, as the observed association may be solely driven by the influence of L.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Solution: ensure confounder is measured prior to the exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: ensure confounders are measured before the exposure\nTo address the problem of conditioning on a common effect, it is crucial to measure all potential confounders before the exposure (A). By measuring confounders prior to exposure, we can ensure that they are not influenced by A and therefore do not lie on the causal pathway between A and Y. This approach allows for proper adjustment and control of confounding variables, ensuring that the estimated causal effect of A on Y is not distorted by conditioning on the common effect L. By measuring all relevant confounders in advance, researchers can minimize bias and obtain more reliable estimates of the true causal relationship between A and Y.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Causal graph reveals bias: solve by stratification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird problem: conditioning on a mediator\nConditioning on a mediator refers to a situation where a variable, known as the mediator (L), lies on the causal pathway between the treatment (A) and the outcome (Y). When conditioning on M, it can lead to biased estimates of the direct causal effect of A on Y. This occurs because conditioning on L may block or distort the true causal pathway between A and Y, making it challenging to isolate the direct effect of A on Y.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Third problem: conditioning on a mediator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: ensure confounders are measured before the exposure.\nTo address the problem of mediator bias, do not condition on a mediator. Ensure that L occurs before A (and Y). This will set you on the path to grace.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Do not condition on a mediator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth problem: conditioning on a descendant\nThe problem of confounding by conditioning on a descendant arises when there is a confounder L that is caused by an unobserved variable U, occurring after the exposure A. Additionally, U also causes the outcome Y, which occurs after L. While A causes L, it does not directly cause Y, and U does not cause A. In this scenario, conditioning on L, which is a descendant of A, can lead to bias. This is because conditioning on L may introduce an association between A and Y that arise from A to L and through the backdoorpath from L through U to Y.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Conditioning on a descendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: (yet again) ensure that counfounders are measured before the exposure\nEnsuring the confounder (L) is measured before the exposure (A) has two beneficial properties. Firstly, it rules out collider bias, which occurs when conditioning on a collider (L) introduces spurious associations. Secondly, if an unmeasured confounder is associated with both A, Y, and L, adjusting for L helps reduce confounding caused by the unmeasured confounder. By measuring L before A, these advantages can be achieved, allowing for more accurate estimation of the causal effect of A on Y.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Solution: conditioning on a descendent is part of the solution, not the problem, when baseline confounders are measured before the exposure."

    "text": "Methods\nThere are two key steps to causal estimation:\n\nFormulate a causal question\nAnswer that question\n\nStep 1: Formulate a causal question\nFormulating a causal question involves describing the outcome, exposure, measured confounders, unmeasured confounders, and causal contrasts.\n\nIdentify the outcome(s) of interest: The outcome is traditionally symbolised by the letter Y. For instance, we could take “Distress as gauged by the Kessler-6 scale” as our selected outcome. It’s crucial to specify the units in which the outcome is measured.\n\nConsider:\n\nThe outcome might be binary (severely distressed/not severely distressed), continuous (the average of the sum of the indicators), or a rate variable (the sum of the indicators).\nIn cases where outcomes are multiple or continuous, transforming the outcome into standard deviation units can be beneficial.\nWe must designate a time period within which the outcome occurs. In three-wave panel designs, this period will typically be one year after the exposure has occurred.\n\n\nDefine the exposure or intervention: Often referred to by the letter A, the exposure is a variable that we hypothesise impacts the outcome. Let’s take A to represent ‘Church attendance’. The exposure, in this instance, remains nebulous until we delineate the unit change in A we are interested in investigating. We may characterise ‘Church Attendance’ as a binary exposure (attend/not attend) or as a continuous exposure (attend weekly/attend monthly).\nIdentify pre-exposure covariates for confounding control: Symbolised as L, these covariates are crucial. For a three-wave panel design, we employ VanderWeele’s modified disjunctive cause criterion: control for any covariate that is a cause of the exposure, the outcome, or both, excluding any instrumental variable and incorporating any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome.\nHighlight unmeasured pre-treatment covariates: These covariates, symbolised by U, can potentially bias the statistical association between A and Y independently of the measured covariates. We recommend creating a causal diagram to illustrate potential sources of bias. Since we can’t ensure the absence of unmeasured confounders in observational settings, it’s vital to conduct sensitivity analyses for the results.\nChoose the scale for a causal contrast: Average causal effects can be inferred by contrasting the expected outcome when a population is exposed to an exposure level, E[Y(A = a)], with the expected outcome under a different exposure level, E[Y(A=a')].\n\nFor a binary treatment with levels A=0 and A=1, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), on the difference scale, is defined as:\nATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1)|L] - E[Y(0)|L]\nOn the risk ratio scale, the ATE can be expressed as:\nATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}\nOther effect scales, such as the incidence rate ratio, incidence rate difference, or hazard ratio, might also be of interest. We can also define the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT):\nATT_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|A=1,L]\nATT_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|A=1,L]}{E[Y(0)|A=1, L]\nOther concepts include the Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE), which signifies the effect the treatment would have on the entire population if applied universally.

    "text": "How do causal estimation\nThere are two key steps to causal estimation:\n\nFormulate a causal question\nAnswer that question\n\nStep 1: Formulate a causal question\nFormulating a causal question involves describing the outcome, exposure, measured confounders, unmeasured confounders, and causal contrasts.\n\nIdentify the outcome(s) of interest: The outcome is traditionally symbolised by the letter Y. For instance, we could take “Distress as gauged by the Kessler-6 scale” as our selected outcome. It’s crucial to specify the units in which the outcome is measured.\n\nConsider:\n\nThe outcome might be binary (severely distressed/not severely distressed), continuous (the average of the sum of the indicators), or a rate variable (the sum of the indicators).\nIn cases where outcomes are multiple or continuous, transforming the outcome into standard deviation units can be beneficial.\nWe must designate a time period within which the outcome occurs. In three-wave panel designs, this period will typically be one year after the exposure has occurred.\n\n\nDefine the exposure or intervention: Often referred to by the letter A, the exposure is a variable that we hypothesise impacts the outcome. Let’s take A to represent ‘Church attendance’. The exposure, in this instance, remains nebulous until we delineate the unit change in A we are interested in investigating. We may characterise ‘Church Attendance’ as a binary exposure (attend/not attend) or as a continuous exposure (attend weekly/attend monthly).\nIdentify pre-exposure covariates for confounding control: Symbolised as L, these covariates are crucial. For a three-wave panel design, we employ VanderWeele’s modified disjunctive cause criterion: control for any covariate that is a cause of the exposure, the outcome, or both, excluding any instrumental variable and incorporating any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome.\nHighlight unmeasured pre-treatment covariates: These covariates, symbolised by U, can potentially bias the statistical association between A and Y independently of the measured covariates.

    "text": "Step 1: State a causal question\nStating a causal question requires describing: a. outcome(s), b. exposure, c. measured confounders, d. (suspected) unmeasured confounders, e. scale of causal contrasts, f. target population for whom the inferences apply.\nWe consider each of these processes in turn.\n\na. Identify the outcome(s) of interest\nWe use Y to denote an outcome of interest. This is the “effect” of interest.\n\nConsider:\n\nThe outcome might be binary (severely distressed/not severely distressed), continuous (the average of the sum of the indicators), or a rate variable (the sum of the indicators).\nIt is crucial to specify the units in which the outcome is measured.\nTransforming the outcome into standard deviation units can be beneficial.\nThe outcome must occur after the exposure or treatment.\nWe must designate a time period within which the outcome occurs, e.g, “the one-year effect of a treatment on well-being as measured by Kessler-6.”\nWe may be interested in multiple outcomes. This is the rational behind outcomewide science [cite tyler]\nWe must remember that the outcome might be measured with error, that such errors may be affected by the treatment or correlated with the measurement error of the treatment. (A topic of future seminars, which we will set to the side for now)\n\nHere, imagine we are interested in understanding only one outcome in our study: well-being as measured by the Kessler-6 depression/anxiety scale.\n\n\n\nb. Define the exposure or intervention\nWe use A to denote the the exposure or treatment. This is the variable that we hypothesise might affect the outcome. This variable denotes the cause of interest. We will restrict our focus to consider in which there is only one treatment (i.e. we will not consider complex multi-treatment regimes.)\nHere, imagine we are interested in understanding the causal effect of ‘Church attendance’.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y, A must occur before Y.\nWhat does A indicate? We may characterise ‘Church Attendance’ as a binary exposure (attend/not attend) or as a continuous exposure (attend weekly/attend monthly). The exposure, in this instance, remains nebulous until we delineate the unit change in A we are interested in investigating.\nFor theoretical and practical purpose we might want to trunctate the variable into categories: (none/some; none/less than weekly, weekly or more)… Why? Because our causal question requires stating the contrast between the states of the world in which we are interested. Additionally, experts often make decisions on the basis of discrete thresholds (has risk of depression/does not).\nWe must remember that an exposure or treatment might be measured with error, that such errors might be correlated with the measurement error of the outcome or affect it. (Again, a topic of future seminars, which we will set to the side for now).\n\n\n\n\nc. Identify pre-exposure covariates for confounding control\nWe use L to denote the set of measured baseline confounders of the the exposure-outcome association. For a three-wave panel design, we employ VanderWeele’s modified disjunctive cause criterion, we advises: control for any covariate that is a cause of the exposure, the outcome, or both, excluding any instrumental variable and incorporating any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y, L must occur before Y.\n\nTo affect A, L must occur before A.\nAlthough we may gain precision by including an L that affects Y but is unrelated to A, including variables that occur after A will be hazardous if it is possible that A affects L (or its measurement).\nA useful set of default counfounders in NZAVS studies is given in your workbooks.\nNote we have left out the concept of “selection bias.” There are indeed sources of bias that may occure after A. This is another topic for the week ahead.\n\n\n\n\nd. Highlight unmeasured pre-treatment covariates\nLet U denoted unmeasured pre-treatment covariates that may potentially bias the statistical association between A and Y independently of the measured covariates.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y and A, U must occur before A.\nIt is useful to draw a causal diagramme to illustrate all potential sources of bias.\nCausal diagrammes are qualitative tools that require specialist expertise. We cannot typically obtain a causal graph from the data.\nA causal diagramme should include only as much information as is required to assess confounding. See Figure 1 for an example.\nBecause we cannot ensure the absence of unmeasured confounders in observational settings, it is vital to conduct sensitivity analyses for the results. For sensitivity analyeses, we use E-values, a topic for a latter seminar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Causal graph: three-wave panel design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne. Choose the scale for a causal contrast\nAverage causal effects can be inferred by contrasting the expected outcome when a population is exposed to an exposure level, E[Y(A = a)], with the expected outcome under a different exposure level, E[Y(A=a')].\nFor a binary treatment with levels A=0 and A=1, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), on the difference scale, is expressed:\nATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1)|L] - E[Y(0)|L]\nOn the risk ratio scale, the ATE is expressed:\nATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}\nOther effect scales, such as the incidence rate ratio, incidence rate difference, or hazard ratio, might also be of interest. We can also define the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) :\nATT_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|A=1,L]\nATT_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|A=1,L]}{E[Y(0)|A=1, L]}\nAnother common estimand is the Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE), which denotes the effect the treatment would have on the entire population if applied universally to that population. This quantity can be expressed:\nPATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = f(E[Y(1) - Y(0)|L], W)\nPATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = f\\left(\\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}, W\\right)\nwhere f is a function that incorporates weights W into the estimation of the expected outcomes. These weights may correspond to the inverse probability of being sampled or in the case of NZAVS data, the survey weights are given from census estimates for the wider population. Note: I will show you how to use weights in future seminars.\nWe might also be interested in identifying effects specific to certain strata, such as risk differences or risk ratios, as they are modified by baseline indicators. Denote a stratum of interest by G. We may then compute:\nATE_{G,\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|G, L]\nATE_{G,\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|G, L]}{E[Y(0)|G, L]}\n\nConsider:\n\n** In this course, we are interested in stratum specific comparisons **\nIn the causal inference literature, the concept we use to make sense of stratum specific comparisons is called “effect modification.”\nBy inferring effects within stratums, we may evaluate whether the effects of different exposures or treatments on some well-defined outcome (measured in some well-defined time-period after the exposure) differ depending on group measurement.\nThe logic of effect modification differs from that of intereaction.\n\n\n\nAside: extensions\nFor continuous exposures, we must stipulate the level of contrast for the exposure (e.g. weekly versus monthly church attendance):\nATE_{A,A'} = E[Y(A) - Y(A')| L]\nThis essentially denotes an average treatment effect comparing the outcome under treatment level A to the outcome under treatment level A'.\nLikewise:\nATE_{A/A'} = \\frac{E[Y(A)| L]}{E[Y(A')| L]}\nThis defines the contrast of A and A' on a ratio scale.\n\n\nf. Describe the population(s) for whom the intended study is meant to generalise.\nThe potential outcomes literature in causal inference distinguishes between the concepts of generalisability and transportability.\n\nGeneralisability refers to the ability to apply the causal effects estimated from a sample to the population it was drawn from.

    "section": "STEP 2: ANSWER A CAUSAL QUESTION",
    "text": "STEP 2: ANSWER A CAUSAL QUESTION\n\nObtain longitudinal data\nNote that causal inference from observational data turns on the appropriate temporal ordering of the key variables involved in the study.\nRecall we have defined.\n\nA: Our exposure or treatment variable, denoted as A. Here we consider the example of ‘Church attendance’.\nY: The outcome variable we are interested in, represented by Y, is psychological distress. We operationalise this variable through the ‘Kessler-6’ distress scale.\nL: The confounding variables, collectively referred to as L, represent factors that can independently influence both A and Y. For example, socio-economic status could be a confounder that impacts both the likelihood of church attendance and the levels of psychological distress.\n\nGiven the importance of temporal ordering, we must now define time:\n\nt \\in T: Let t denote within a multiwave panel study with T measurement intervals.\n\nWhere t/\\text{{exposure}} denotes the measurement interval for the exposure. Longitudinal data collection provides us the ability to establish a causal model such that:\nt_{confounders} &lt; t_{exposure}&lt; t_{outcome}\nTo minimise the posibility of time-varying confounding and obtain the clearest effect estimates, we should acquire the most recent values of \\mathbf{L} preceding A and the latest values of A before Y.\nNote in Figure 7, We use the prefixes “t0, t1, and t2” to denote temporal ordering. We include in the set of baseline confounders the pre-exposure measurement of A and Y. This allows for more substantial confounding control. For unmeasured confounder to affect both the exposure and the outcome, it would need to do so independently of the pre-exposure confounders. Additionally, including the baseline exposure gives us an effect estimate for the incidence exposure, rather than the prevelance of the exposure. This helps us to assess the expected change in the outcome were we to initate a change in the exposure.\n\n\nInclude the measured exposure with baseline covariates\nControlling for prior exposure enables the interpretation of the effect estimate as a change in the exposure in a manner akin to a randomised trial. We propose that the effect estimate with prior control for the exposure estimates the “incidence exposure” rather than the “prevalence exposure” (Danaei, Tavakkoli, and Hernán 2012). It is crucial to estimate the incidence exposure because if the effects of an exposure are harmful in the short term such that these effects are not subsequently measured, a failure to adjust for prior exposure will yield the illusion that the exposure is beneficial. Furthermore, this approach aids in controlling for unmeasured confounding. For such a confounder to explain away the observed exposure-outcome association, it would need to do so independently of the prior level of the exposure and outcome.\n\n\nState the eligibility criteria for participation\nThis step is invaluable for assessing whether we are answering the causal question that we have asked.\n\nConsider:\n\nGeneralisability: we cannot evaluate inferences to a target group from the source population if we do not describe the source population\nEligibility criteria will help us to ensure whether we have correctly evaluated potential measurement bias/error in our instruments.\n\nFor example, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a National Probability study of New Zealanders. The details provided in the supplementary materials describe how individuals were randomly selected from the country’s electoral roll. From these invitations there was typically less than 15% response rate. How might this process of recruitment affect generalisability and transportability of our results?\n\nAside: discuss per protocol effects/ intention to treat effects\n\n\n\n\nDetermine how missing data will be handled\n\nAs we will consider in the upcoming weeks, loss to follow up and non-response opens sources for bias. We must develop a strategy for handling missing data.\n\n\n\nState a statistical model\nThe models we have considered in this course are G-computation, Inverse Probability of Treatement Weighting, and Doubly-Robust estimation.\n\n\nReporting\nConsider the following ideas about how to report one’s model:\n\nEstimator: Doubly robust where possible.\nPropensity Score Reporting: Detail the process of propensity score derivation, including the model used and any variable transformations.\nWeightIt Package Utilisation: Explicitly mention the use of the ‘WeightIt’ package in R, including any specific options or parameters used in the propensity score estimation process.\nMethod Variations: Report if different methods were used to obtain propensity scores, and the reasons behind the choice of methods such as ‘ebal’, ‘energy’, and ‘ps’.\nContinuous Exposures: Highlight that for continuous exposures, only the ‘energy’ option was used for propensity score estimation.\nSubgroup Estimation: Confirm that the propensity scores for subgroups were estimated separately, and discuss how the weights were subsequently combined with the original data.\nCovariate Balance: Include a Love plot to visually represent covariate balance on the exposure both before and after weighting.\nWeighting Algorithm Statistics: Report the statistics for the weighting algorithms as provided by the WeightIt package, including any measures of balance or fit.\nOutcome Regression Model: Clearly report the type of regression model used to estimate outcome model coefficients (e.g., linear regression, Poisson, binomial), and mention if the exposure was interacted with the baseline covariates. Do not report model coefficients as these have no interpretation.\nSubgroup Interaction: Address whether the subgroup was included separately as an interaction in the outcome model, and if the model successfully converged.\nModel Coefficients: Note that the model coefficients should not be interpreted, as they are not meaningful in this context.\nConfidence Intervals and Standard Errors: Describe the methods used to derive confidence intervals and standard errors, noting the use of the ‘clarify’ package in R for simulation based inference.\n\n\n\nExample of how to report a doubly robust method in your report\nI have included the technical details of the doubly robust method in the Appendix. Here is a how you might report a doubly robust causal inference method in your report:\nOur study employs a Doubly Robust Estimation for Subgroup Analysis algorithm, combining the best of the IPTW and G-computation methodologies. The method hinges on the specification of either the propensity score or the outcome model to provide unbiased estimates.\nFirstly, the propensity score, representing the conditional probability of exposure given covariates and subgroup indicators, is estimated using logistic regression or a suitable alternative. We then calculate individual weights based on these estimated propensity scores. Importantly, these scores are computed separately within strata of the subgroup where effect modification is of interest, before being recombined into the complete data set.\nSecondly, we estimate the outcome model, aiming to capture the relationship between the outcome, exposure, confounders, and subgroups. This model helps us predict the average outcome given specific values of exposure, covariates, propensity scores, and subgroup indicators.\nThe third step involves simulating potential outcomes for each individual in each subgroup under hypothetical scenarios. We calculate these outcomes under varying exposure levels, using the previously estimated outcome model.\nThe fourth step estimates the average causal effect for each subgroup by computing the expected value of potential outcomes under each intervention level. This information is then used to calculate the estimated difference, which represents the average causal effect of altering the exposure within each subgroup.\nLastly, we compare differences in causal effects between groups by computing the estimated causal effect differences between different subgroups. This step identifies the difference in average causal effects between the subgroups. To quantify uncertainty around the estimated causal effects, we calculate standard errors and confidence intervals using simulation-based inference methods.\nThis five-step process provides a robust and nuanced examination of causal effects, considering exposure, outcome, covariates, and subgroup indicators, to deliver an accurate and comprehensive analysis of causal relationships in our study population.”\n\n\nInference\nConsider the following ideas about what to discuss in one’s findings:\n\nInterpretation of Propensity Scores: Understand and articulate the meaning of the propensity scores, and how they relate to the exposure of interest in the study.\nAnalysis of Outcome Models: Analyze the outcome models to understand the relationships between the outcome, exposure, confounders, and subgroups.\nHypothetical Scenarios: Reason through the hypothetical scenarios used in the simulation of potential outcomes, and discuss their relevance to the research question.\nEffect of Intervention Levels: Consider the implications of different intervention levels on potential outcomes, and how they inform the average causal effect within each subgroup.\nCausal Effect Interpretation: Interpret the average causal effect of changing the exposure level within each subgroup, and discuss its relevance to the research question.\nComparison of Subgroups: Analyze and discuss the differences in causal effects between different subgroups, and how these differences contribute to the overall findings of the study.\nUncertainty and Confidence Intervals: Consider the uncertainty around the estimated causal effects, and interpret the confidence intervals to understand the precision of the estimates.\nAssumptions and Limitations: Reflect on the assumptions made during the study and identify any limitations in the methodology that could affect the interpretation of results.\nReplication and Future Research: Consider how the study could be replicated or expanded upon in future research, and how the findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field.\nPositivity Violations: Reflect on any violations of the positivity assumption. Ensure that for each combination of covariates, there is a positive probability of receiving each level of treatment.\nCausal Consistency and Treatment Heterogeneity: Consider the assumption of causal consistency and the potential for treatment heterogeneity.

Identify the outcome(s) of interest\nWe use Y to denote an outcome of interest. This is the “effect” of interest.\n\nConsider:\n\nThe outcome might be binary (severely distressed/not severely distressed), continuous (the average of the sum of the indicators), or a rate variable (the sum of the indicators).\nIt is crucial to specify the units in which the outcome is measured.\nTransforming the outcome into standard deviation units can be beneficial.\nThe outcome must occur after the exposure or treatment.\nWe must designate a time period within which the outcome occurs, e.g, “the one-year effect of a treatment on well-being as measured by Kessler-6.”\nWe may be interested in multiple outcomes. This is the rational behind outcomewide science [cite tyler]\nWe must remember that the outcome might be measured with error, that such errors may be affected by the treatment or correlated with the measurement error of the treatment. (A topic of future seminars, which we will set to the side for now)\n\nHere, imagine we are interested in understanding only one outcome in our study: well-being as measured by the Kessler-6 depression/anxiety scale.\n\n\n\nb. Define the exposure or intervention\nWe use A to denote the the exposure or treatment. This is the variable that we hypothesise might affect the outcome. This variable denotes the cause of interest. We will restrict our focus to consider in which there is only one treatment (i.e. we will not consider complex multi-treatment regimes.)\nHere, imagine we are interested in understanding the causal effect of ‘Church attendance’.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y, A must occur before Y.\nWhat does A indicate? We may characterise ‘Church Attendance’ as a binary exposure (attend/not attend) or as a continuous exposure (attend weekly/attend monthly). The exposure, in this instance, remains nebulous until we delineate the unit change in A we are interested in investigating.\nFor theoretical and practical purpose we might want to trunctate the variable into categories: (none/some; none/less than weekly, weekly or more)… Why? Because our causal question requires stating the contrast between the states of the world in which we are interested. Additionally, experts often make decisions on the basis of discrete thresholds (has risk of depression/does not).\nWe must remember that an exposure or treatment might be measured with error, that such errors might be correlated with the measurement error of the outcome or affect it. (Again, a topic of future seminars, which we will set to the side for now).\nIt must be conceptually possible to intervene within all stratums of baseline confounders (strong positivity).\nIt must be conceptually possible to understand an intervention on the exposure (consistency)\nThe multiple version of the intervention must exchangeable within levels of measured baseline confounders (consistency).\n\n\n\n\nc. Identify pre-exposure covariates for confounding control\nWe use L to denote the set of measured baseline confounders of the the exposure-outcome association. For a three-wave panel design, we employ VanderWeele’s modified disjunctive cause criterion, we advises: control for any covariate that is a cause of the exposure, the outcome, or both, excluding any instrumental variable and incorporating any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y, L must occur before Y.\n\nTo affect A, L must occur before A.\nWe must acheive balence within levels of the exposure such that A\\coprod Y| L\nAlthough we may gain precision by including an L that affects Y but is unrelated to A, including variables that occur after A will be hazardous if it is possible that A affects L (or its measurement).\nA useful set of default counfounders in NZAVS studies is given in your workbooks.\nNote we have left out the concept of “selection bias.” There are indeed sources of bias that may occure after A. This is another topic for the week ahead.\n\n\n\n\nd. Highlight unmeasured pre-treatment covariates\nLet U denoted unmeasured pre-treatment covariates that may potentially bias the statistical association between A and Y independently of the measured covariates.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y and A, U must occur before A.\nIt is useful to draw a causal diagramme to illustrate all potential sources of bias.\nCausal diagrammes are qualitative tools that require specialist expertise. We cannot typically obtain a causal graph from the data.\nA causal diagramme should include only as much information as is required to assess confounding. See Figure 1 for an example.\nBecause we cannot ensure the absence of unmeasured confounders in observational settings, it is vital to conduct sensitivity analyses for the results. For sensitivity analyeses, we use E-values, a topic for a latter seminar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Causal graph: three-wave panel design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne. Choose the scale for a causal contrast\nAverage causal effects can be inferred by contrasting the expected outcome when a population is exposed to an exposure level, E[Y(A = a)], with the expected outcome under a different exposure level, E[Y(A=a')].\nFor a binary treatment with levels A=0 and A=1, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), on the difference scale, is expressed:\nATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1)|L] - E[Y(0)|L]\nOn the risk ratio scale, the ATE is expressed:\nATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}\nOther effect scales, such as the incidence rate ratio, incidence rate difference, or hazard ratio, might also be of interest. We can also define the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) :\nATT_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|A=1,L]\nATT_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|A=1,L]}{E[Y(0)|A=1, L]}\nAnother common estimand is the Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE), which denotes the effect the treatment would have on the entire population if applied universally to that population. This quantity can be expressed:\nPATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = f(E[Y(1) - Y(0)|L], W)\nPATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = f\\left(\\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}, W\\right)\nwhere f is a function that incorporates weights W into the estimation of the expected outcomes. These weights may correspond to the inverse probability of being sampled or in the case of NZAVS data, the survey weights are given from census estimates for the wider population. Note: I will show you how to use weights in future seminars.\nWe might also be interested in identifying effects specific to certain strata, such as risk differences or risk ratios, as they are modified by baseline indicators. Denote a stratum of interest by G. We may then compute:\nATE_{G,\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|G, L]\nATE_{G,\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|G, L]}{E[Y(0)|G, L]}\n\nConsider:\n\n** In this course, we are interested in stratum specific comparisons **\nIn the causal inference literature, the concept we use to make sense of stratum specific comparisons is called “effect modification.”\nBy inferring effects within stratums, we may evaluate whether the effects of different exposures or treatments on some well-defined outcome (measured in some well-defined time-period after the exposure) differ depending on group measurement.\nThe logic of effect modification differs from that of intereaction.\n\n\n\nAside: extensions\nFor continuous exposures, we must stipulate the level of contrast for the exposure (e.g. weekly versus monthly church attendance):\nATE_{A,A'} = E[Y(A) - Y(A')| L]\nThis essentially denotes an average treatment effect comparing the outcome under treatment level A to the outcome under treatment level A'.\nLikewise:\nATE_{A/A'} = \\frac{E[Y(A)| L]}{E[Y(A')| L]}\nThis defines the contrast of A and A' on a ratio scale.\n\n\nf. Describe the population(s) for whom the intended study is meant to generalise by distinguishing between source and target populations.\nConsider the following concepts:\n\nSource population: A source population is where we gather our data for a study. We pull our specific sample from this group. It needs to mirror the broader group for our conclusions to be valid and widely applicable.\nTarget population: The target population is the larger group we aim to apply our study’s results to. It could be defined by location, demographics, or specific conditions. The closer the source matches the target in ways that are relevant to our causal questions, the stronger our causal inferences about the target population will be.\n\nGeneralisability refers to the ability to apply the causal effects estimated from a sample to the population it was drawn from. In simpler terms, it deals with the extrapolation of causal knowledge from a sample to the broader population. This concept is also called “external validity”.\n\n\n\\text{Generalisability} = PATE \\approx ATE_{\\text{sample}}\n\nTransportability refers to the ability to extrapolate causal effects learned from a source population to a target population when certain conditions are met. It deals with the transfer of causal knowledge across different settings or populations.\n\n\\text{Transportability} = ATE_{\\text{target}} \\approx f(ATE_{\\text{source}}, T)\nwhere f is a function and T is a function that maps the results from our source population to another population. To achieve transportability, we need information about the source and target populations and an understanding of how the relationships between treatment, outcome, and covariates differ between the populations. Assessing transportability requires scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\nSummary Step 1: Consider how much we need to do when asking a causal question!\nWe discover that asking a causal question is a multifaceted task. It demands careful definition of the outcome, including its timing, the exposure, and covariates. It also requires selecting the appropriate scale for causal contrast, controlling for confounding, and potentially adjusting for sample weights or stratification. Finally, when asking a causal question, we must consider for whom the results apply. Only after following these steps can we then ask: “How may we answer this causal question?”"

Fit a model for the outcome Y, conditional on both the exposure A, the covariates L, and subgroup indicator G. This model can be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another statistical model. The goal is to capture the relationship between the outcome, exposure, confounders, and subgroups.\n E(Y|A,L,G) = f_Y(A,L,G, \\theta_Y) \nThis equation represents the expected value of the outcome Y given the exposure A, covariates L, and subgroup G as modeled by the function f_Y with parameters \\theta_Y. This formulation allows for the prediction of the average outcome Y given certain values of A, L, and G.\nStep 2 Simulate potential outcomes. For each individual i in each subgroup g, predict their potential outcome \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a) under the intervention A=a using the estimated outcome model.\n\\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a) = E[Y|A=a,L_i,G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y]\nand also under the intervention A=a^{\\prime}:\n\\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a^{\\prime}) = E[Y|A=a^{\\prime},L_i,G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y]\nThis step involves simulating the outcomes under each intervention level for every individual within each subgroup, as if they were exposed to treatment level a or a^{\\prime}.\nStep 3 Estimate the average causal effect for each subgroup. Compute the estimated expected value of the potential outcomes under each intervention level for each subgroup g:\n\\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] = \\frac{1}{N_g}\\sum_{i:G_i=g}^N \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a)\n\\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g] = \\frac{1}{N_g}\\sum_{i:G_i=g}^N \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a^{\\prime})\nand calculate the estimated difference for each subgroup g:\n\\hat{\\delta}_g = \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g]\nThis difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level a^{\\prime} to level a within subgroup g.\nStep 5 Compare differences in causal effects by subgroups.\nCompute the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups:\n\\hat{\\gamma}_s = \\hat{\\delta}_g - \\hat{\\delta}_{g^{\\prime}}\nThis difference \\hat{\\gamma}_s represents the difference in the average causal effects between the subgroups g and g^{\\prime}.\nOr more fully:\n\\hat{\\gamma}_{s} = \\overbrace{\\big( E[Y(a)|G=g] - E[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g] \\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_g}} - \\overbrace{\\big(E[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g^{\\prime}]- E[Y(a)|G=g^{\\prime}]\\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_{g^{\\prime}}}} \nThis difference, \\gamma_s, represents the difference in the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level a^{\\prime} to level a between subgroup g and subgroup g^{\\prime}. It measures the interaction effect of the exposure A and the subgroup G on the outcome Y.\nWe use simulation-based inference methods to compute standard errors and confidence intervals (Greifer et al. 2023)\n\n\nInverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) for Subgroup Analysis Algorithm\nStep 1 Estimate the propensity score. The propensity score e(L_i, G) is the conditional probability of the exposure A_i = 1, given the covariates L_i and subgroup indicator G. This can be modeled using logistic regression or other suitable methods, depending on the nature of the data and the exposure.\n e(L_i, G) = P(A_i = 1 | L_i, G) = f_A(L_i, G; \\theta_A) \nHere, f_A(L_i, G; \\theta_A) is a function (statistical model) that estimates the probability of the exposure A_i = 1 given covariates L_i and subgroup G. The estimated propensity scores are denoted as \\hat{e}(L_i, G_i).\nThen, we calculate the weights for each individual i, denoted as v_i, using the estimated propensity score:\nv_i = \\left(\\frac{A_i}{\\hat{e}(L_i)} + \\frac{1 - A_i}{1 - \\hat{e}(L_i)}\\right)\\bigg|_{G}\nNote that we estimate propensity scores separately within strata of the subgroup for whom we are interested in effect modification.”\nv_i is the weight for individual i in a given subgroup G. It calculated using the propensity score estimated within the same subgroup, these weights are then recombined into the full data set with all groups.\nStep 2 Fit a weighted outcome model. Using the weights calculated from the estimated propensity scores, fit a model for the outcome Y, conditional on the exposure A, subgroup G, and covariates L:\n \\hat{E}(Y|A, G, L) = f_Y(A, G; \\theta_Y, V) \nwhere f_Y is a weighted function (such as a weighted regression model) with parameters \\theta_Y, and V represents the weights. This formulation allows for the prediction of the outcome Y given certain values of A, G, and L, taking into account the inverse probability of treatment weights.\nStep 3 Simulate potential outcomes. For each individual i in each subgroup g, simulate their potential outcome \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a) under the hypothetical scenario where everyone in the subgroup is exposed to the intervention A=a regardless of their actual exposure level:\n\\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a) = E[Y|A=a,G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y, v_i]\nand also under the hypothetical scenario where everyone is exposed to intervention A=a^{\\prime}:\n\\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a^{\\prime}) = E[Y|A=a^{\\prime},G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y, v_i]\nStep 4 Estimate the average causal effect for each subgroup. Compute the estimated expected value of the potential outcomes under each intervention level for each subgroup g:\n\\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] = \\sum_{i:G_i=g}^N \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a)\n\\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g] = \\sum_{i:G_i=g}^N \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a^{\\prime})\nThen calculate the estimated difference for each subgroup g:\n\\hat{\\delta}_g = \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g]\nThe difference \\hat{\\delta}_g represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level a^{\\prime} to level a within each subgroup g.\nStep 5 Compare differences in causal effects by groups. Compute the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups:\n\\hat{\\gamma}_s = \\hat{\\delta}_g - \\hat{\\delta}_{g^{\\prime}}\nThis difference \\hat{\\gamma}_s represents the difference in the average causal effects between the subgroups g and g^{\\prime}.\nWe compute standard errors and confidence intervals. Again, to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals for these differences in subgroup-specific causal effects, we use simulation-based inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023).\n\n\nDoubly Robust Estimation for Subgroup Analysis Algorithm\nDoubly Robust Estimation is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of both the IPTW and G-computation methods. It uses both the propensity score model and the outcome model, which makes it doubly robust: it produces unbiased estimates if either one of the models is correctly specified.\nStep 1 Estimate the propensity score. The propensity score e(L_i, G) is the conditional probability of the exposure A_i = 1, given the covariates L_i and subgroup indicator G. This can be modeled using logistic regression or other suitable methods, depending on the nature of the data and the exposure.\n e(L_i, G) = P(A_i = 1 | L_i, G) = f_A(L_i, G; \\theta_A) \nHere, f_A(L_i, G; \\theta_A) is a function (statistical model) that estimates the probability of the exposure A_i = 1 given covariates L_i and subgroup G. The estimated propensity scores are denoted as \\hat{e}(L_i, G_i).\nThen, we calculate the weights for each individual i, denoted as v_i, using the estimated propensity score:\nv_i = \\left(\\frac{A_i}{\\hat{e}(L_i)} + \\frac{1 - A_i}{1 - \\hat{e}(L_i)}\\right)\\bigg|_{G}\nNote that we estimate propensity scores separately within strata of the subgroup for whom we are interested in effect modification.”\nv_i is the weight for individual i in a given subgroup G. It calculated using the propensity score estimated within the same subgroup, these weights are then recombined into the full data set with all groups.\nStep 2 Estimate the outcome model.\nFit a model for the outcome Y, conditional on both the exposure A, the covariates L, subgroup indicator G, and the propensity scores V. This model can be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another statistical model. The goal is to capture the relationship between the outcome, exposure, confounders, and subgroups.\n E(Y|A,L,V,G) = f_Y(A,L,V,G, \\theta_Y) \nThis equation represents the expected value of the outcome Y given the exposure A, covariates L, the propensity score v_i, and subgroup G as modeled by the function f_Y with parameters \\theta_Y. This formulation allows for the prediction of the average outcome Y given certain values of A, L, V,and G.\nStep 3 Simulate potential outcomes. For each individual i in each subgroup g, simulate their potential outcome \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a) under the hypothetical scenario where everyone in the subgroup is exposed to the intervention A=a regardless of their actual exposure level:\n\\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a) = E[Y|A=a,G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y,L_i, v_i]\nand also under the hypothetical scenario where everyone is exposed to intervention A=a^{\\prime}:\n\\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a^{\\prime}) = E[Y|A=a^{\\prime},G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y,,L_i, v_i]\nStep 4 Estimate the average causal effect for each subgroup. Compute the estimated expected value of the potential outcomes under each intervention level for each subgroup g:\n\\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] = \\sum_{i:G_i=g}^N \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a)\n\\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g] = \\sum_{i:G_i=g}^N  \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a^{\\prime})\nThen calculate the estimated difference for each subgroup g:\n\\hat{\\delta}_g = \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g]\nThe difference \\hat{\\delta}_g represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level a^{\\prime} to level a within each subgroup g.\nStep 5 Compare differences in causal effects by groups. Compute the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups:\n\\hat{\\gamma}_s = \\hat{\\delta}_g - \\hat{\\delta}_{g^{\\prime}}\nThis difference \\hat{\\gamma}_s represents the difference in the average causal effects between the subgroups g and g^{\\prime}.\nAgain we can see this explicitly:\n\\hat{\\gamma}_{s} = \\overbrace{\\big( E[Y(a)|G=g] - E[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g] \\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_g}} - \\overbrace{\\big(E[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g^{\\prime}]- E[Y(a)|G=g^{\\prime}]\\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_{g^{\\prime}}}} \nWe again calculate standard errors and confidence intervals using simulation-based inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023). This helps to quantify the uncertainty around the estimated causal effects."

    "text": "Step 1: Pose a Causal Question**\nThis involves defining: a) outcome(s), b) exposure, c) measured confounders, d) suspected unmeasured confounders, e) scale of causal contrasts, and f) target population for the inferences.\n\na. Define the Outcome(s)\nWe symbolise the outcome of interest as Y, the ‘effect’.\nConsiderations:\n\nOutcomes can be binary (severely distressed/not severely distressed), continuous (average of sum of indicators), or rate variables (sum of indicators).\nSpecify the outcome units.\nStandardizing the outcome can be helpful.\nOutcome must follow exposure.\nDesignate a time frame for the outcome, e.g., “one-year effect of treatment on well-being as measured by Kessler-6.”\nMultiple outcomes are possible, aligning with outcome-wide science.\nBe aware of possible measurement errors in outcomes. For now, imagine we’re studying one outcome: well-being as per the Kessler-6 depression/anxiety scale.\n\n\n\nb. Define the Exposure or Intervention\nThe exposure or treatment, which we believe may affect the outcome, is denoted by A.\nConsiderations:\n\nA should precede Y.\nHow is A defined? ‘Church Attendance’ might be binary (attend/not attend) or continuous (attend weekly/attend monthly).\nTruncating the variable into categories could be beneficial for stating causal contrasts and for practicality.\nMeasurement errors in exposure are possible.\nIntervention should be conceptually possible across all baseline confounder strata (strong positivity).\nIt should be feasible to understand the exposure intervention (consistency).\nDifferent intervention versions should be exchangeable within measured baseline confounder levels (consistency).\n\n\n\nc. Identify Pre-Exposure Covariates for Confounding Control\nWe use L to denote measured baseline confounders of the exposure-outcome association. For a three-wave panel design, we apply VanderWeele’s modified disjunctive cause criterion.\nConsiderations:\n\nL should precede both Y and A.\nWe should achieve balance within exposure levels such that A\\coprod Y| L\nIncluding variables that occur after A can be risky if A possibly affects L.\nA handy set of default confounders for NZAVS studies is provided in your workbooks.\nNote: We’re omitting ‘selection bias’ for now. Some biases may occur after A, but that’s a topic for another time.”\n\n\n\nd. Identify Unmeasured Pre-Treatment Covariates\nLet U represent unmeasured pre-treatment covariates that could bias the A and Y association, apart from measured covariates.\nConsiderations:\n\nU must precede A to affect Y and A.\nCausal diagrams help visualize potential bias sources.\nCausal diagrams require expertise and can’t usually be derived from data.\nDiagrams should include only necessary information to assess confounding.\nSensitivity analyses are crucial in observational settings due to potential unmeasured confounders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Causal graph: three-wave panel design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne. Select Causal Contrast Scale\nAverage causal effects are inferred by contrasting expected outcomes at different exposure levels: E[Y(A = a)] and E[Y(A=a')].\nBinary treatment A=0 and A=1 Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is expressed as:\nRisk difference scale: ATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1)|L] - E[Y(0)|L]\nRisk ratio scale: ATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}\nOther scales (incidence rate ratio, incidence rate difference, or hazard ratio) may also apply. Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) and Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE) can be defined as:\nATT:\n\nATT_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|A=1,L]\nATT_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|A=1,L]}{E[Y(0)|A=1, L]}\n\nPATE:\n\nPATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = f(E[Y(1) - Y(0)|L], W)\nPATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = f\\left(\\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}, W\\right)\n\nHere, f is a function incorporating weights W into outcome estimation. These weights may be inverse sampling probability or, in NZAVS data, census-based survey weights for the general population.\nWe may also compute effects specific to strata, denoted by G:\n\nATE_{G,\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|G, L]\nATE_{G,\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|G, L]}{E[Y(0)|G, L]}\n\nNote that we often explore stratum-specific comparisons using “effect modification.”\n\n\nf. Define Source and Target Populations\n\nSource population: Where we collect data. It should resemble the broader group to ensure valid and generalizable conclusions.\nTarget population: The group we aim to apply our study results to, defined by location, demographics, or specific conditions.\n\nThe generalizability or external validity refers to the application of causal effects from a sample to the broader population:\n\\text{Generalisability} = PATE \\approx ATE_{\\text{sample}}\nTransportability refers to extrapolating causal effects from a source population to a target population when certain conditions are met:\n\\text{Transportability} = ATE_{\\text{target}} \\approx f(ATE_{\\text{source}}, T)\nHere, f is a function and T is a function mapping the results from our source population to another population.\nSummary Step 1: A lot goes into asking a causal question!\nAsking a causal question involves defining the outcome, exposure, and covariates, choosing the right scale for causal contrast, managing confounding, and possibly adjusting for sample weights or stratification. You also have to consider the population to which the results apply. Only then can you ask: “How may we answer this causal question?”"
