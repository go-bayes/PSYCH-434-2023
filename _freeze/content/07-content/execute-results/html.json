To address this, we multiply impute missing values on the assumption that missing values are random conditional on the imputation model (MAR).](07-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-1.png){#fig-dag width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Downloads\n\nBelow is a link to the R script that will allow you to download the data and exercises. Copy the contents on your screen to a new R script, and run the script from the begging. Before class, it will be useful for you to: \n\n1. Run \"source()\" file. \n2. Download the synthetic data. \n3. Create a folder in your Rstudio project called \"data\"\n4. Place the downloaded file in your data folder.\n\n\n[link to script for this week ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-bayes/psych-434-2023/ab93ccac0b03c9ae46ab310f37d32951b77e406d/scripts/434-intro-causal-inference-week-7.R)\n\n\n\n\n## Overview\n  \n  \n  \n## What is a Cause and What is an Effect? \n\n\n\n\n## Why is Causal Inference a “missing data” problem?\n\n\n\nb.
