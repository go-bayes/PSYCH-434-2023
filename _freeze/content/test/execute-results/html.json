What do we want to know? Before all else, we must ask, and motivate this question. \n\nSuppose we have defined a question. How can we address it using observational data? \n\nThis is the topic of today's siminar.\n  \n  \n\n## How do we do causal estimation?\n\nThere are two steps to causal estimation:\n\n1. State a causal question\n2. Answer that question [Cite Hernan]\n\n\n\n## Step 1: State a causal question\n\nStating a causal question requires describing: a. outcome(s), b. exposure, c. measured confounders, d. (suspected) unmeasured confounders, e. scale of causal contrasts, f. target population for whom the inferences apply. \n\nWe consider each of these processes in turn.\n\n",
